🧪Equistart Labs aims at creating digital public goods/tools and also create an ecosystem for new learning opportunites. 
Decentralised Autonomous Organisation or DAOs is a type of organisation that is run using blockchain technology and smart-contracts.
DAOs have potential to revolutionize the way organisations are structured and operated, by transfering the control from central entity to the group of users that are participating.
DAOs offer a more transparent and democratic alternative to the traditional organizations, by solving core problems in traditional organisations, including governance, fundraising, and project management.

🥳FunFact: The first DAO was created on Ethereum to fund the ecosystem projects, although it was famously hacked, resulting into the split of Ethereum Main Chain, into 2 (classic Eth, current Eth)

- 🔭 We're currently working on [**Equistart - The DAO Suite**](https://github.com/EquistartLabs/Equistart_v1)

- 🌱 We are currently learning and building **Web3, DAOs, DApps, Defi, Solidity and more**

- 👯 Join in our journey with Equistart [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/0xEquistart) or [**Discord**]()

- 🤝 Start with our React-Native Mobile dapp framework **Equistarter kit**

- 💬 Ask us about **Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)**

- ⬜️ [**Whitepaper**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lx1gxT-PVs6VSOFPRhlbBIfAtP_mDldRDkFwWjS_TMU/edit?usp=sharing) (Under Development)

## 🧪 Project Description
Equistart - The DAO Suite aims at creating a full stack DAO suite for a community to create their Decentralised Autonomous Organization with no code and mobile support. Creating a DAO is a tedious task with no single application providing an end-to-end solution and Information. With our dapp, users can easily mint their tokens, raise funds by selling parts of tokens, manage the raised funds (Treasury Management/ AMM), and finally Govern the project bound by tokens in a decentralized and autonomous fashion.

<br />

### Summary:
Internet unlocked a vast universe of new Applications over the past decades and now blockchain is 
revolutionising how we can manage our financial assets over the network of computers in a decentralised manner.
This idea can be extrapolated and can be used to build the future together in a cooperative DAO model.

🥳FunFact: The first DAO was created on Ethereum to fund the ecosystem projects, although it was famously hacked, resulting into the split of Ethereum Main Chain, into 2 (classic Eth, current Eth)
